//! # Event Sourcing
//!
//! An eventsourcing library for Rust
//!
//! One of the benefits of [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)
//! is that in most cases, embracing this pattern does not require that much code.
//! However, there's still a bit of boilerplate required as well as the discipline for ensuring
//! the events, commands, and aggregates all perform their roles without sharing concerns.
//!
//! The fundamental workflow to remember is that **commands** are applied to **aggregates**,
//! which then emit one or more events. An **aggregate**'s business logic is also responsible
//! for returning a new state from a previous state combined with a new event. Put
//! mathematically, this looks like:
//!
//! ```terminal,ignore
//! f(state1, event) = state2
//! ```
//!
//! There are some event sourcing libraries that allow for, or even encourage, mutation of
//! state in memory. I prefer a more functional approach, and the design of this library
//! reflects that. It encourages you to write unit tests for your aggregate business logic that
//! are predictable and can be executed in isolation without concern for how you receive events
//! or how you persist them in a store.
//!
//! To start, you create an undecorated enum for your **Command** type:
//! ```rust
//! enum LocationCommand {
//!    UpdateLocation { lat: f32, long: f32, alt: f32 },
//!}
//! ```
//!
//! Next, you create an enum for your events and use a derive macro to write some boilerplate
//! on your behalf. Note how the command variants are _imperative_ statements while the
//! event variants are _verbs phrases in the past tense_. While this is by convention and
//! not enforced via code, this is a good practice to adopt.
//! ```rust
//!
//!# extern crate serde;
//!# #[macro_use] extern crate serde_derive;
//!# extern crate eventsourcing;
//!# extern crate serde_json;
//!# #[macro_use] extern crate eventsourcing_derive;
//!const DOMAIN_VERSION: &str = "1.0";
//!#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, Event)]
//!#[event_type_version(DOMAIN_VERSION)]
//!#[event_source("events://github.com/pholactery/eventsourcing/samples/location")]
//!enum LocationEvent {
//!    LocationUpdated { lat: f32, long: f32, alt: f32 },
//!}
//! ```
//!
//! We then define a type that represents the state to be used by an aggregate.
//! With that in place, we write all of our business logic, the core of our event sourcing system,
//! in the aggregate.

//!# }
//!# enum LocationCommand {
//!#    UpdateLocation { lat: f32, long: f32, alt: f32 },
//!# }

//!    lat: f32,
//!    long: f32,
//!    alt: f32,
//!    generation: i64,
//!}

//!               alt: *alt,
//!               generation: state.generation + 1,
//!           },
//!       };
//!       Ok(ld)
